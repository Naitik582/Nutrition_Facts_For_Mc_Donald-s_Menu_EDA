**McDonald's Menu Nutrition - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Project Overview**

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on McDonald's menu nutrition dataset to analyze calories, fat, protein, carbs, sugar, and other nutritional aspects. The goal is to help health-conscious users make informed food choices.

**Key Objectives**

1. Load and clean the McDonald's menu dataset

2. Compute Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation)

3. Perform Time Series Analysis to understand Total Fat trends

4. Conduct Customer & Product Analysis for category-wise nutritional insights

5. Use Data Visualization (bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) to present findings

6. Provide key insights and recommendations for better food choices


**Technologies Used**

• Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

• Google Colab (Data Analysis & Visualization)


**Dataset Details**

Source: McDonald's Official Nutrition Facts

Features: Calories, Total Fat, Saturated Fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Carbohydrates, Sugar, Protein, Vitamins

Size: Medium dataset (~100+ food items)


**Key Insights**

1. Calories: Some items contain up to 1880 kcal, which is extremely high.


2. Fat: Certain meals have 1000+ kcal from fat, making them unhealthy.


3. Carbs & Sugar: Some items contain 140g carbs and 128g sugar, which may be risky for diabetics.


4. Protein: Meals with 20g+ protein are ideal for muscle building.


5. Healthiest Choices: Egg White Delight, Grilled Chicken (low fat, high protein).


6. Unhealthy Choices: Large Burgers, Fries, Milkshakes (high fat, sugar, and calories).



**Data Visualizations**

• Calories Distribution → Histogram

• Category-wise Calories → Boxplot

• Total Fat vs Calories → Scatter Plot

• Correlation Heatmap → Nutrient Relationships


**(Conclusion)**

• Fast food can be part of a balanced diet if chosen wisely. Grilled, low-fat, and high-protein options are preferable, while high-sugar and high-fat foods should be avoided.

**{How to Use}**

1. Upload the dataset as menu.csv


2. Run the Google Colab Notebook


3. Analyze the charts and insights


4. Use the findings to make healthier food choices


**{Future Scope}**

• Compare multiple fast-food chain menus

• Create an interactive dashboard (Power BI/Tableau)

• Use Machine Learning for personalized food recommendations
